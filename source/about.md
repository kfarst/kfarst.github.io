I am a software engineer in Silicon Valley with over 6 years of experience in web development. Working primarily as a full-stack Ruby on Rails developer, I've since switched to AngularJS, helping to build a large production application from the ground up.

On the mobile side of things, I've attend both the iOS For Engineers and the Android for Engineers bootcamps through [Codepath](http://codepath.com/).

I really enjoy helping others and try to dedicate myself to "paying back" those who have helped me develop my career by building the skills of others as a mentor and teacher.

As a part of that mentoring and teaching, I help others with their code on [Codementor](http://codementor.io) and teach a [Beginner Angular 2 Class](https://www.codementor.io/classes/learn-beginner-angular2-live).

Additionally, I always try to contribute to many open source projects and continue building my skills to in turn help others as the development landscape changes.

You can find the majority of my open source work on my [GitHub](http://github.com/kfarst).
