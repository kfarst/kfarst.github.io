I am a software engineer in Silicon Valley with over 7 years of experience in web and mobile development. I
have a diverse background as a full-stack Ruby on Rails developer, front-end AngularJS, and iOS developer in
multiple capacities and roles, as well as a team lead and manager.

On the mobile side of things, I've attend both the *iOS For Engineers* and the *Android For Engineers* bootcamps
through [Codepath](http://codepath.com/).

I really enjoy helping others and try to dedicate myself to "paying back" those who have helped me develop
my career by building the skills of others as a mentor and teacher.

As a part of that mentoring and teaching, I help others with their code on [Codementor](http://codementor.io)
and teach a [Beginner Angular 2 Class](https://www.codementor.io/classes/learn-beginner-angular2-live).

Additionally, I always try to contribute to many open source projects and continue building my skills to in
turn help others as the development landscape changes.
