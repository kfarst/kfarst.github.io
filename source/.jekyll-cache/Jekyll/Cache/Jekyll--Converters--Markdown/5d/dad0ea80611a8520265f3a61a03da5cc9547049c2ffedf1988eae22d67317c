I"ÓS<p>A little while back, I was asked to put together a small pair programming exercise for iOS candidates to work through
during an interview to help highlight and demonstrate their skill set in relation to the tools and concepts used in my
company‚Äôs iOS application. I thought it might be interesting to re-hash my though process and steps as I worked through (and
re-worked) the process of putting it all together.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>

<p>Our app pretty much exclusively gets its data by consuming JSON from our API, so I needed to build the exercise based off
of connecting to endpoints and processing their JSON responses. If you‚Äôve read some of my other blog posts, I‚Äôm fond of using
<a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api">The Movie Database</a> API due to its verbose documentation, as well as its
ease of authentication. All you need to do is register for an account and you‚Äôll get a unique API key that you simply pass
along as a parameter to each of your requests. Our app also doesn‚Äôt use too many third party libraries, so I wanted to limit
the toolset to (mostly) using built-in Apple libraries, or as least using any outside packages as minimally as possible. Also,
I had to figure out a way to timebox what I would be working on with the candidate to one hour (the average length of the interviews).</p>

<h2 id="toolset">Toolset</h2>

<p>Without going into a ton of detail, some of the concepts and tools my company‚Äôs app used which I wanted to incorporate into
the interview exercise are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The majority of the app is written in Objective-C</li>
  <li><code>UINavigationController</code></li>
  <li><code>UITabBarController</code></li>
  <li>Programmatic views</li>
  <li>Constraints by way of the Visual Formatting Language</li>
  <li>CocoaPods</li>
  <li>Newer features and classes were being written in Swift</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="exercise-requirements">Exercise Requirements</h2>

<p>Taken directly from the <a href="https://github.com/kfarst/ios-code-interview/blob/master/README.md">README</a> in the repo, I put together these requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>List movie categories as a <code>UITabBar</code>, with the following categories:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/get-now-playing">Now Playing</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/get-popular-movies">Popular</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/get-top-rated-movies">Top Rated</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/get-upcoming">Upcoming</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Display results for each list in a <code>UITableView</code></li>
  <li>In each table cell, display the <code>title</code>, <code>overview</code>, and <code>posterPath</code> of the movie</li>
  <li>Load the <code>posterPath</code> image asynchronously</li>
  <li>Add at least one unit test, written in <em>Swift</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Also for clarity, I added these additional specs to give a complete overview of the app</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Language</strong>: Objective-C (Swift for unit tests)</li>
  <li><strong>Minimum supported iOS version</strong>: 10.0</li>
  <li><strong>Orientation support</strong>: Portrait only</li>
  <li><strong>Device support</strong>: iPhone only</li>
  <li><strong>Localizations</strong>: Not needed</li>
  <li><strong>Dependencies</strong> (app is slightly structured toward these packages, however everything can be built with native-only APIs or dependencies of your choice):
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/jsonmodel/jsonmodel">JSONModel</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/rs/SDWebImage">SDWebImage</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/JJSaccolo/UIActivityIndicator-for-SDWebImage">UIActivityIndicator-for-SDWebImage</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/mxcl/PromiseKit">PromiseKit</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Dependency management</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods">CocoaPods</a> (can change to your choice)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="initial-thoughts">Initial thoughts</h2>

<p>While I originally was debating on whether to have the candidate start the interview with a bare bones skeleton or not, I quickly
realized that the time allowed would need me to restrict the pairing portion of the interview to key areas where the candidate would
fill in missing portions of code, or perhaps build out very simple classes. You can see for yourself in the <a href="https://github.com/kfarst/ios-code-interview">repo</a> what those areas were,
but I tried to make them as general as possible so as to not force him or her to write the code <em>exactly</em> how I had, but instead still achieve
the same result with their own direction.</p>

<p>Additionally, I felt the dependencies I chose provided enough support during the interview that the interviewee would not get caught up
in the tedious nitty-gritty of some of the setup, but instead could focus on the high-level feature set to demonstrate their skills. As a bonus,
I could see how they dissected third-party code and documentation for the information they would need to utilize these packages.</p>

<h2 id="the-process">The Process</h2>

<p>I won‚Äôt cover every detail of developing the coding exercise, though I‚Äôd like to go over some of the highlights of putting together the features that
make up the codebase, some of the decisions I made, and the process of ‚Äúfleshing them out‚Äù.</p>

<h4 id="movie-list-categories">Movie list categories</h4>

<p>One of the first things to note for each of the movie list categories (Now Playing, Popular, Top Rated, and Upcoming) is that the tab name, header title
and API endpoint all use the same text, albeit it different formats. The tab and header use a title format whereas the endpoints use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case">snake case</a>
for proper URL formatting.</p>

<p><img src="http://imgur.com/e2buYMJ.png" width="100%" /></p>

<p>For simplicity‚Äôs sake, I hard-coded the endpoints to a lazily-instantiated property</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-objective-c" data-lang="objective-c">  @interface AppDelegate ()
  ...
  @property (nonatomic, strong) NSArray *movieListTypes;

  @end

  @implementation AppDelegate
    ...
    - (NSArray *)movieListTypes
    {
        if (_movieListTypes == nil) {
            _movieListTypes = @[
                                    @"now_playing",
                                    @"popular",
                                    @"top_rated",
                                    @"upcoming"
                                ];
        }
        return _movieListTypes;
    }
  @end</code></pre></figure>

<p>I also created a method to titleize a passed in endpoint</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-objective-c" data-lang="objective-c">- (NSString *)titleizeEndpoint:(NSString *)endpoint
{
    NSMutableArray *capitalizedWords = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];

    [[endpoint componentsSeparatedByString:@"_"] enumerateObjectsUsingBlock: ^(NSString *word, NSUInteger idx, BOOL *stop){
        [capitalizedWords addObject:[word capitalizedString]];
    }];

    return [capitalizedWords componentsJoinedByString:@" "];
}</code></pre></figure>

<p>Finally, I combined the property and method to build the <code>UITabBarController</code> and <code>UINavigationController</code>s
with the appropriate endpoint and title</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-objective-c" data-lang="objective-c">  [self.movieListTypes enumerateObjectsUsingBlock: ^(NSString *endpoint, NSUInteger idx, BOOL *stop){
      MovieListViewController *movieListViewController = [[MovieListViewController alloc] initWithClient: weakSelf.client forEndpoint:endpoint];
      UINavigationController *navigationController = [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewController:movieListViewController];
      navigationController.topViewController.title = [weakSelf titleizeEndpoint:endpoint];
      navigationController.tabBarItem.title = [weakSelf titleizeEndpoint:endpoint];
      [tabBarControllers addObject:navigationController];
  }];</code></pre></figure>

<h4 id="json-model">JSON Model</h4>

<p>In order to simplify the process of deserializing the JSON coming back from the API, I decided to use
the <a href="https://github.com/jsonmodel/jsonmodel">JSONModel</a> CocoaPod so as to not bog down the candidate
with tedious JSON deserialization. Although this could be a good exercise in seeing how the candidate
handles JSON HTTP responses, in this case there were more important concepts to focus on. I figured it would 
give me a glimpse in seeing how the candidate seeks out documentation for the library, as they were tasked with adding
the properties to the model, as well as telling JSONModel to map the JSON keys from snake case to camel case
when deserializing.</p>

<p><em>MovieModel.h</em></p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-objective-c" data-lang="objective-c">#import &lt;JSONModel/JSONModel.h&gt;

@interface MovieModel : JSONModel

  @property (nonatomic) NSString *title;
  @property (nonatomic) NSString *overview;
  @property (nonatomic) NSString *posterPath;
  @property (nonatomic) NSString *releaseDate;

@end</code></pre></figure>

<p><em>MovieModel.m</em></p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-objective-c" data-lang="objective-c">#import "MovieModel.h"

@implementation MovieModel

  + (JSONKeyMapper *)keyMapper
  {
      return [JSONKeyMapper mapperForSnakeCase];
  }

@end</code></pre></figure>

<h4 id="promises">Promises</h4>

<p>This was one of the most interesting challeges to work through with a candidate. While most iOS engineers are very comfortable
in handling asynchronous behavior with callbacks, <em>promises</em>, though similar, still take a bit of getting used to. The fact that you
can chain promises, rather than have a series of nested callbacks, takes a bit of practice for building and implementing. As a result though, I believe
promises can make for much cleaner code.</p>

<p>My company‚Äôs application was written using a homegrown implementation of promises. In the case of the pairing challenge however, I decided to go
with <a href="https://github.com/mxcl/PromiseKit">PromiseKit</a> as it both allows the candidate to not concern themselves with the internals of a custom construct,
but may also hasten the process if he or she has ever used the third-party library, not to mention PromiseKit‚Äôs thorough documentation.</p>

<p>I started off with defining private property and method definitions in the implementation file.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-objective-c" data-lang="objective-c">  #import "MovieClient.h"

  @interface MovieClient ()

  @property (nonatomic, strong) NSURLSession *URLSession;
  - (NSURLRequest *)requestForMovieListWithType:(NSString *)listType;

  @end</code></pre></figure>

<p>My company‚Äôs app implemented the API client by instanting it once and passing it around controllers where needed, so I followed the same pattern.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-objective-c" data-lang="objective-c">  @implementation MovieClient

  NSString  *const BASE_URL = @"https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/%@?api_key=%@";
  NSString *const  API_KEY = @"key goes here";

  - (instancetype)init
  {
      self = [super init];

      if (self != nil) {
          self.URLSession = [NSURLSession sessionWithConfiguration:[NSURLSessionConfiguration defaultSessionConfiguration] delegate:nil delegateQueue:NSOperationQueue.mainQueue];
      }

      return self;
  }
  ...</code></pre></figure>

<p>Since each endpoint followed the same format, only one public method was needed, <code>fetchMovieList</code>, in which the movie list category type was passed in
and a promise of type <code>AnyPromise</code> was returned.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-objective-c" data-lang="objective-c">  - (AnyPromise *)fetchMovieList:(NSString *)listType
  {
      return [self.URLSession promiseDataTaskWithRequest:[self requestForMovieListWithType:listType]];
  }</code></pre></figure>

<p>The <code>NSURLRequest</code> was constructed and returned from <code>requestForMovieListWithType</code>, which would take in the <code>listType</code> string, and interpolate the <code>API_KEY</code> and <code>listType</code>
into the <code>BASE_URL</code>.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-objective-c" data-lang="objective-c">  - (NSURLRequest *)requestForMovieListWithType:(NSString *)listType
  {
      NSString *typeEncoded = [listType stringByAddingPercentEncodingWithAllowedCharacters:[NSCharacterSet URLFragmentAllowedCharacterSet]];
      NSString *apiKeyEncoded = [API_KEY stringByAddingPercentEncodingWithAllowedCharacters:[NSCharacterSet URLFragmentAllowedCharacterSet]];

      NSURL *url = [NSURL URLWithString:[NSString stringWithFormat:BASE_URL, typeEncoded, apiKeyEncoded]];

      return [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:url];
  }</code></pre></figure>

<p>Now, if the request was executed, the app would crash with this message:</p>

<p><img src="http://imgur.com/fo1GclL.png" width="100%" /></p>

<p>This error would guide the interviewee to notice <code>PromiseKit</code> was complaining that the request was being executed on the main thread. Through some discussion and/or
possible documentation reading, he or she would come to the conclusion they would need to instantiate a new <code>NSOperationQueue</code> for the <code>NSURLSession</code>.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-objective-c" data-lang="objective-c">  @interface MovieClient ()

  ...
  @property (nonatomic, strong) NSOperationQueue *requestQueue;
  ...

  @end

  @implementation MovieClient

  - (instancetype)init
  {
      self = [super init];

      if (self != nil) {
          self.URLSession = [NSURLSession sessionWithConfiguration:[NSURLSessionConfiguration defaultSessionConfiguration] delegate:nil delegateQueue:self.requestQueue];
      }

      return self;
  }

  -(NSOperationQueue *) requestQueue {
      if (_requestQueue == nil) {
          _requestQueue = [[NSOperationQueue alloc] init];
      }
      return _requestQueue;
  }
  ...</code></pre></figure>

<h4 id="programmatic-views">Programmatic Views</h4>

<p>The code challenge app only consisted of two programmatic views, a <code>LoadingView</code> and a custom <code>MovieTableViewCell</code>.
The <code>LoadingView</code> was provided in full, for both the interviewee to focus on more important topics, as well as to
potentially be used as a guide for ‚Äúfleshing out‚Äù the needed parts of the <code>MovieTableViewCell</code>. The <code>MovieTableViewCell</code>
doesn‚Äôt really handle any sort of special configuration, but a couple of items just to showcase are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Interpolating the <code>posterPath</code> into a <code>POSTER_BASE_URL</code> and rendering it asynchronously</li>
</ul>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-objective-c" data-lang="objective-c">  NSString * const POSTER_BASE_URL = @"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185/%@";
  ...
  - (void)configureWithMovie:(MovieModel *)movie
  {
      self.titleLabel.text = movie.title;
      self.overviewLabel.text = movie.overview;

      NSString *posterPathEncoded = [movie.posterPath stringByAddingPercentEncodingWithAllowedCharacters:[NSCharacterSet URLFragmentAllowedCharacterSet]];
      NSString *urlString = [NSString stringWithFormat:POSTER_BASE_URL, posterPathEncoded];

      [self.posterImageView setImageWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:urlString] usingActivityIndicatorStyle:UIActivityIndicatorViewStyleGray];
  }</code></pre></figure>

<ul>
  <li>Lazily-instantiated UI properties, which was a pattern I mimicked throughout the exercise to reflect the app the candidate would be working on when hired.
However, the starting point only defined the properties, and the interviewee could instantiate them however he or she wanted.</li>
</ul>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-objective-c" data-lang="objective-c">  - (UILabel *)titleLabel
  {
      if (_titleLabel == nil)
      {
          _titleLabel = [[UILabel alloc] init];
          _titleLabel.text = @"";
          _titleLabel.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = NO;
          _titleLabel.lineBreakMode = NSLineBreakByWordWrapping;
          _titleLabel.font = [UIFont boldSystemFontOfSize:16.0];
          _titleLabel.numberOfLines = 1;
          _titleLabel.lineBreakMode = NSLineBreakByTruncatingTail;
      }
      return _titleLabel;
  }
  ...</code></pre></figure>

<ul>
  <li>Using <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/VisualFormatLanguage.html">Visual Formatting Language</a> for
constrants. Again, not a requirement, but encouraged to test the potential hire‚Äôs skillset.</li>
</ul>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-objective-c" data-lang="objective-c">  -(void)updateConstraints
  {
      NSMutableArray *constraints = [NSMutableArray new];
      NSDictionary *views = NSDictionaryOfVariableBindings(
                                                           _titleLabel,
                                                           _overviewLabel,
                                                           _posterImageView
                                                           );
      [constraints addObjectsFromArray: [NSLayoutConstraint
        constraintsWithVisualFormat: @"H:|-[_posterImageView(80)][_titleLabel]-|"
        options:0
        metrics:nil
        views:views]];
      ...
      ...
    [self.contentView addConstraints:constraints];
    [super updateConstraints];
  }</code></pre></figure>

<h4 id="unit-testing-and-swift">Unit Testing and Swift</h4>

<p>Because all work going forward on my company‚Äôs app was in Swift, the candidate should have at least a basic knowledge of it. I figured I could ‚Äúkill two birds with one stone‚Äù by
having him or her write at least one unit test in Swift. Unit and UI tests are something I feel I don‚Äôt see enough of in iOS applications, so I wanted to see how comfortable the iOS
engineer was in writing them, as it would be something strongly encouraged for each new feature and bug fix.</p>

<p>Adding Swift into the mix could also show me how the candidate handled Swift integration in an Objective-C project, considering he or she would need to create a bridging header and
translate initialization syntax from an Objective-C class to a new instance declaration in Swift, depending on what the interviewee wanted to test. For my test, I simply verified
the return value of the <code>fetchMovieList</code> method in the <code>MovieClient</code> class was indeed of type <code>AnyPromise</code>.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift">  <span class="o">...</span>
  <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="kt">TheMovieDatabaseAppTests</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">XCTestCase</span> <span class="p">{</span>

  <span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Putting together a code pairing exercise for potential job candidates was both a difficult and enjoyable experience. I felt it helped me make better decisions about how to structure functionality
around technical requirements and best practices according to the project at hand, not just meeting business requirements. Though my company‚Äôs app was a good guide for how and what I wanted to test against,
it was a productive challenge trying to put myself in the shoes of the candidate, how they would think about coming up with a solution for each step, and finding a balance between skill testing and time constraints.</p>
